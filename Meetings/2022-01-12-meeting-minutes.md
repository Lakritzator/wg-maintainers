## Notes

Rob Prouse was unable to join, that’s why the meeting was not recorded.


Alternate meeting times for people in other time zones:

Nicole to have Nadeem send out a find time for the committee members to make it easier.

A discussion was had about earlier, same or later by an hour. Most of the committee stated that the time worked for now, but when the time changes happens it will be early in Australia.

Proposal by @SeanKilleen about maintainer satisfaction

Google Form for a survey to Maintainers and Project Leaders via Mailchimp

Q: Do we want to have one answer for a project, or per maintainer?
A:  Sean is interested in hearing from both, but individual responses from all maintainers of a project for the survey.

This will be tabled until the next meeting when Rob can be present
